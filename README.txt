MISSION PROFILES:

Kerbin - Minmus - Kerbin
Difficulty : Easy
Notes: Really? If you're has trouble with this mission it could be time to go back to flight school!

Kerbin - Mun - Kerbin
Difficulty : Easy
Notes: Aim for a 10k orbit above the Munar surface, do a nice gentle de-orbit burn to bring you in at a slight angle, not too steep.

Kerbin - Mun - Minmus - Kerbin
Difficulty : Medium
Notes: As long as you keep your burns nice and efficient you'll make it back with juice to spare. If you're having trouble try doing Minmus first, you'll have less weight to content with once you do your mun landing.

Kerbin - Duna - Duna Orbit
Difficulty : Medium
Notes: Try and bleed off as much speed in the atmosphere as you can, the closer you can get to 400 m/s the better. You don't want to use the engines when the atmosphere will do the job for you. I tried my very best to make it back to Kerbin from Duna but I couldn't quite get there. I think it's possible but you'll certainly be down to the last drops of fuel! On the plus side you'll have plenty of gas left to get you back into orbit and rendezvous with a waiting tanker. I say tanker but the Sprite will only need a few sips of fuel to get you back home again.

Kerbin - Laythe - Kerbin
Difficulty : Scott Manley
Notes: This is one for expert level players only! Your mission will have to be perfectly planned and flawlessly executed. You're also going to have to lose some of the oxidizer in the central tanks and tweak the ascent profile to get yourself out the atmosphere quicker to save on liquid fuel. Don't bother with Jool just aim straight for Laythe and try and find yourself a nice big mountain to land on if you can. While it is possible to do the return burn straight from Laythe a slingshot or two around Tylo will help save on those last drops of fuel.

Kerbin - Duna - Kerbin
Difficulty : Chuck Norris
Notes: Your Kerbal will probably die. Use Mechjeb.


UNTESTED POTENTIAL MISSIONS:

Kerbin - Duna Aerobrake - Ike - Kerbin
Difficulty : Unknown

Kerbin - Eve Aerobrake - Gilly - Kerbin
Difficulty : Unknown


CONTROLS:

0 - Activate Airsync (Important, use on start-up)
1 - Toggle Turbojet
2 - Toggle Rockets
3 - Toggle Nav Lights
5 - Toggle High Altitude Intakes (Reduces Drag On Ascent)
9 - Toggle Ladder

ABORT - Undock/Decouple Top Docking Port


AIR WHAT?

Air Sync works by closing all the intakes before takeoff, the same intakes are also set to toggle along with the jet engine. In short this means jet engine on - intakes open, jet engine off - intakes closed, all without having to lift a finger.


STANDARD MISSION PROFILE:

Activate SAS, set control to the top docking port (vertical) press 0 to activate airsync, 1 to fire up the engines and 5 to close the high altitude intakes.
Head straight up to 15,000m then pitch over to 45` on a 90` heading.
At around 25,000m press 5 to re-open the high altitude intakes.
At 30,000m pitch down towards the horizon, you want your apoapsis to read 40,000m (the orbital info tab from Mechjeb is highly recommended).
Adjust your pitch to hold altitude at 40,000m and keep building up speed.
As you get towards 2300m/s you'll be pitching almost flat towards the horizon. Once you pass orbital velocity (2300m/s) your apoapsis will start rising rapidly. At this point you can set the SAS to point prograde and just concentrate on working the throttle.
Keep the jet going as long as you can by slowly reducing throttle, you'll still generate small amounts of thrust until you're almost out the atmosphere.
If everything's gone to plan you'll have an apoapsis of around 210,000m and a small amount of liquid fuel reserve you can use for landing later on.
Once out the atmosphere press 1 to shutdown the jet and 2 to activate the rocket motors. You can now circularize or in some cases go straight for a munar injection/interplanetary burn.
Using the top docking port will cause the Sprite to behave like a regular rocket. It's essential that you use this orientation for burns with the navball or Mechjeb control. On landing you should use horizontal (VTOL) orientation which you can switch to do by pressing C twice.
On returning to Kerbin aim for a high altitude reentry height (30-40,000m). At this height only small amounts of thrust from the turbo jet will let you make suborbital hops and get you back to the KSC using only tiny amounts of fuel.
On landing use the jet and rocket engines together to help get rid of any throttle lag.


Hope you enjoy the craft, and good luck with your missions.
